Hello! I'm a PhD candidate in the UCD Environmental Dynamics Lab with a passion for open-source software. Most of my code is focused on [geospatial data science](https://github.com/klarrieu/RiverREM) and [hydrodynamic modeling](https://github.com/RiverArchitect/program) applications. My hobby projects include [GPU-accelerated fractal rendering](https://github.com/klarrieu/fractal_explorer), [web server streaming of weather sensor data](https://github.com/klarrieu/weather_station), and developing stock trading algorithms. Always looking to learn more.
