Hello! I'm a PhD candidate in the UCD Environmental Dynamics Lab with a passion for open-source software. Most of my code is focused on [geospatial data science](https://github.com/klarrieu/RiverREM) and [hydrodynamic modeling](https://github.com/SI3DL/psi3d) [applications](https://github.com/RiverArchitect/program). My hobby projects include [fractal rendering](https://github.com/klarrieu/fractal_explorer), [making weather stations](https://github.com/klarrieu/weather_station), playing with Raspberry Pi and ESP32. Always looking to learn more.
